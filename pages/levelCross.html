	  <h2>At the crossing</h2> <br>
	  <p> Some crossings have flashing red road traffic signals; these mean STOP (and this applies to pedestrians too). A steady amber light shows before the red lights begin to flash, as at ordinary road traffic signals; this means STOP unless it is unsafe to do so. If the red lights flash for more than three minutes without a train arriving (other than at crossings with full barriers), or any barrier is lowered without the lights flashing, phone the signal operator. When the barriers rise, do not proceed until the signals go out. If your vehicle breaks down or stalls on a crossing, get yourself and your passengers out of the vehicle as soon as possible. Phone the signal operator and follow the instructions given. Stand well clear of the crossing if the alarm sounds, the signals show or the barriers lower. 
		<br> <br>   
	  The St Andrew’s cross is used at level crossings where there are no gates or barriers. At automatic crossings, you must always STOP when the traffic light signals show. At crossings with "give way" signs, always look out for and give way to trains </p>
