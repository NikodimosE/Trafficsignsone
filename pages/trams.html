	  <p>Trams can run on roads used by other vehicles and pedestrians. The part of the road used by trams (the "swept path") may have a different colour or textured surface to the rest of the road, or it may be edged with special road markings. Keep the "swept path" clear. <br> <span style="font-weight: Bold">Trams cannot move out of the way of other road users!</span></p>

	<p>The word "local" on the bus symbol means the only buses that may use the lane are those running a local service. Where the word "local" is not shown, the lane may be used by any vehicle designed to carry more than 8 passengers, excluding the driver, and local buses. Solo motorcycles may use the lane where the motorcycle symbol is shown on the signs. Other vehicles may enter and stop in a bus lane to load and unload unless signs alongside the lane indicate otherwise.</p>
