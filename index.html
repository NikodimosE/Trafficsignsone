      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Are you learning to pass your Driving Theory Test in the Isle of Man, or are you just touching up you knowledge? Then this is the site for you! Browse through our extensive website to learn about the signs, signals and road markings you can come across day-to-day when driving in the Isle of Man and also the UK (although signs found on this site may not reflect the signs found in the UK).
      </p>
      <p>
        Even though the signs on this website are for the Isle of Man, there will be some that apply to the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland, as the Isle of Man doesn't have the applicable infrastructure, for example, the IoM has no motorways, but there will be signs that include motorways here. This is denoted by an <span class="red-asterisk">*</span> at the end of a sign's description.
